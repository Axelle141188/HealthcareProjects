Addressing these missing values is crucial for accurate analysis; options include imputing the missing BMI data or excluding those rows. Ensuring data completeness helps maintain the reliability of the stroke risk analysis and supports the development of effective prevention strategies.</p>

            <p>This pie chart visualizes the distribution of smoking statuses in the stroke dataset, highlighting that 37% never smoked, 30.2% data is missing, 17.3% are former smokers, and 15.4% currently smoke. This is crucial for understanding the prevalence of smoking, a significant stroke risk factor, and for planning targeted prevention strategies. The high proportion of missing data (null) indicates the need for careful handling to ensure accurate analysis.</p>

            <p>This pie chart visualizes the distribution of smoking statuses in the stroke dataset, showing that 52.9% never smoked, 25% formerly smoked, and 22.1% currently smoke. This helps identify smoking as a significant risk factor for strokes and informs targeted prevention strategies. The high proportion of current and former smokers highlights the need for effective public health interventions.</p>

            <p>Splitting the dataset based on the 'stroke' column reveals 4826 non-stroke cases and 247 stroke cases, highlighting a significant imbalance. This step is crucial for targeted risk factor analysis, handling data imbalance, and identifying trends. Understanding this distribution helps in comparing characteristics between the groups and designing effective stroke prevention strategies.</p>

            <p>Balancing the dataset by upsampling stroke cases ensures an equal 50/50 distribution between stroke and non-stroke cases, as shown in the pie chart. This step eliminates bias, improves predictive model performance, and allows for accurate analysis of stroke risk factors. The balanced dataset enables fair and reliable analysis and identification of significant stroke predictors.</p>
